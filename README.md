Weather Analysis
===============

Big data project analyzing weather dataset.

#### DATA ####
The dataset is a collection of daily weather measurements (temperature, wind speed, humidity,
pressure, etc.) from 20000+ weather stations around the world. It has various attributes such as
Mean temperature, Mean dew point, Mean sea level pressure, Mean station pressure, Mean visibility,
Mean wind speed, Maximum sustained wind speed, Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature,
Precipitation amount, Snow depth etc. Data collected by NCDC over the last 85 years. The data is
available through ftp at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/.


#### Tasks ####

- **Minimum and Maximum Temperatures** using *Hive* and *Java*.
- **K-means Clustering** using iterative Map-Reduce in *Java*.
- **Weather prediction** by training models using *Weka*.
