It has various attributes such as\r\nMean temperature, Mean dew point, Mean sea level pressure, Mean station pressure, Mean visibility,\r\nMean wind speed, Maximum sustained wind speed, Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature,\r\nPrecipitation amount, Snow depth etc. Data collected by NCDC over the last 85 years. The data is\r\navailable through ftp at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Tasks ####\r\n\r\n- **Minimum and Maximum Temperatures** using *Hive* and *Java*.\r\n- **K-means Clustering** using iterative Map-Reduce in *Java*.\r\n- **Weather prediction** by training models using *Weka*.\r\n\r\n========================\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
